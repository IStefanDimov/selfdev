# The Power of Neuroplasticity by  Shad Helmstetter

## Your Brain

Your brain is changing at this moment. Right now, no matter where you are in your life or what age you are, while you're reading this, your brain is literally rewiring itself.

What goes on in your mind and in your life — changes your brain, physically. When you think or do something repeatedly, your brain actually changes its physical structure. Your environment, your experiences, your emotions, your attitudes, your self-talk, all of your perceptions — your brain is imprinting itself with every message it gets.

And this discovery means that because your brain is constantly rewiring and changing itself, you are creating now, the person you're going to become tomorrow. 

## The Feedback Loop

Your brain grows and changes based on feedback. What you tell it, changes it. And while it's rewiring itself, your brain then feeds those new programs, those new pictures of yourself, back to you.

The neural activity feedback loop is the process by which: Everything we think, feel, or do, imprints or rewires our brain. Our rewired brain, in turn, affects everything we think, feel, or do … which again, in turn, imprints or rewires our brain.

In time, your brain will continue to rerecord programs, making them so strong that you can actually believe they are "real," part of who you are. And thought by thought, moment by moment, day by day, you act out the results.

## The Brain Gets rid of unused circuits

The neuroplastic brain is continually changing itself based on the latest information it's receiving, then the person you thought you were up to now, is not necessarily the most important determinant of the you you're about to become next. The brain gets rid of circuits that are no longer being used.

## External Inputs

### People around you

Because of the way your brain will unconsciously duplicate neural activity of the person you're with, anyone you spend your time with can imprint your brain with their programs. And neither of you will know it is happening.

But you can counteract some negative input from others by making sure your own self-talk and your programs are so healthy, so positive, and so strong that in the war of the neurons, yours will be the strongest programs, and negatives from others won't be strong enough to override them.

The opinions, ideas, and beliefs you hear from the people around you, are all programs. When you hear those opinions, ideas, and beliefs repeated frequently, you can be sure your brain is busy wiring their thoughts into your head.

### The Places You Spend The Most Time

You're not only programmed by the words someone speaks; your brain receives messages from virtually everything it perceives around you. Your home can be a storehouse of memories, emotions, and messages — some good, some not so good.

### Usual Activities

With each of your activities, ask the question — is it helping me program my mind in the healthiest and most positive way?

## Overriding Brain Programs

Each of us has a miraculous quality of the conscious mind that's able to override previously stored programs in our mental software, and create new decisions which are made seemingly independent of, or in spite of, our old programs. Because of this ability of your conscious mind — through your thoughts and your brain's neuroplasticity — you are able to reprogram your brain and create new neural pathways. This is accomplished by the conscious selection and direction of your thoughts, repeated often enough for your old patterns to change.

Your computer has two operators: Your conscious mind, and your silent controller. One is the mind, your conscious, active, thinking mind. The other is an invisible synaptic neurological process that goes on behind the scenes, within your brain — choosing, selecting, and making thousands of your choices for you, day in and day out, and as a result, literally voting on, determining, and creating the life you live each day. This silent, invisible operator is your brain on autopilot, the part of your brain that actually makes most of your decisions for you. It sets up your feelings, and predetermines your actions and unconscious responses.

These decisions are made by an unconscious process that is controlled by the number and strength of the programs you have on any given subject or attitude, and whether your programs are positive or negative — which simply means whether they work for you or against you.

let's say you're at lunch and you're trying to decide whether you should break your diet and have the Death by Chocolate for dessert. You may think a brief thought or two about it, such as "Hmmm, let's see, should I order the chocolate cake or not?" But before the decision comes to you consciously, it's actually being made for you, unconsciously, without you even knowing your silent controller is making the choice. Here's what's instantly happening in your brain: Hundreds of prerecorded neural programs made up of your beliefs about your diet, your weight, needing comfort, deserving dessert, what your mother might have told you as a child, how well the day has gone for you so far, and countless other pre-programmed messages that are all connected to the choice you're about to make about whether or not to order the dessert — all those programs vote, silently and instantly. The vote is counted, and the results are collected by your brain, which delivers the verdict to your conscious mind. Autopilot: The dessert wins.

This is where "free will" comes into the picture. It is when you exercise conscious control over the autopilot and exercise your free will to do so, that you actually put your true "self" in control.

1. Am I being consciously mindful? Am I always aware that my thoughts are programming my brain? 2. Am I making my choices consciously, or are my old unconscious programs making them for me? 3. Do I know exactly what my intention is? Do I know exactly what I want? Do I know the goal? 4. Do I focus on my goals, and on the programs I want to create? 5. Am I using repetition to create the programs I want to create? 6. Am I adding positive feelings and emotion to the programs I'm creating? 7. Do I have strong, positive belief in the outcome? Asking yourself those questions frequently will help you recognize and practice the most important rules of neuroplastic programming.

As we're using it here, mindfulness is the process of being consciously aware of your own mental environment and activity in a purposeful way, at all times. It is your self-directed awareness of your own mind and what you're doing with it.

As we're using it here, mindfulness is the process of being consciously aware of your own mental environment and activity in a purposeful way, at all times. It is your self-directed awareness of your own mind and what you're doing with it. Mindfulness, in these pages, is "paying attention to paying attention."

When you'd like your brain to do something special for you, the more attention you give to what your mind is doing, the better you'll be able to direct your brain to help you accomplish it.

With mindfulness, your mind is right here, and on high awareness. Being highly aware creates an electrochemical state in the brain that alerts it to — and keeps it mindful of — your objective. This self-

With mindfulness, your mind is right here, and on high awareness. Being highly aware creates an electrochemical state in the brain that alerts it to — and keeps it mindful of — your objective.

In the broader sense of being mindful, you're increasing your general awareness of the natural programming process of your brain.

When you're mindful: You are aware that every message you give your brain is being recorded.

When you practice mindfulness, you begin to create new thought-directing programs which override any previous programs that may have allowed you unconsciously to move toward the negative instead of the positive.

When you're mindful: You are aware that your choices change your programs.

When you're mindful: By being more aware of your programming, you create stronger programs.

When you're mindful: You're aware that the objective you're working on at this moment is something that is important to you, and you want your brain to pay close attention.

When you're mindful: You improve your memory.

When you hold your attention on one thought for even 10 or 15 seconds or more, in a state of focused mindfulness, you upgrade that thought from short-term memory storage to longer-term memory storage.

Remember, you're in charge; your brain isn't. It's your job to be mindful, make the choices, set the course you want your brain to follow, and stay mindful throughout the day, every day.

Look out for things that seem to be harmless, everyday distractions or habits that can go unnoticed. They're a part of our lives, and seem normal, but are the opposite of mindfulness.

A third habit I'll mention, that can take the place of mindfulness, is the Internet. The number of hours a week people spend on social networks alone is astonishing. I would only recommend that if you want to be mindful, you will have to be aware of what you're doing with your mind now, and then decide if that's what you really want to be doing.

Your choices affect your programs, and your programs affect your choices. Each choice you make gets recorded in your brain, and if you repeat that same choice often enough, it will actually form its own set of neural pathways and connections in your brain.

When you're changing your brain, choose thoughtfully what you want your brain to record.

Just as important, or often, more important, than our conscious choices are the unconscious choices we make — and we make hundreds of them in a day. These smaller choices are vitally important, because they make up the countless small steps we take that lead us either toward the objective, or away from it.

What's troubling about this is that it means your choices are being made by program pathways that could be the wrong programs — and often are.

The value of being mindful of your smallest choices is that by doing so, you take the control over each of them away from the unthinking, silent controller that could otherwise sabotage you.

Intention is a powerful and essential rewiring tool.

When you're rewiring your brain, your success will depend on your mental direction and on the amount of intention you create in your own mind.

So you focus on that idea, and you give it a lot of energy. You don't do this just once; you think about your goal again and again, day after day. Over and over, you picture the goal in your mind. After a short time, you begin to see yourself reaching your goal, and each day, the picture of the realization of your goal becomes clearer. You find yourself each day making choices, including the little choices that help you define and take steps that will bring you closer to making your once-imagined goal a physical reality.

That's what intention will do for you. Intention is the driving force of creation.

If you want to get your wiring right, you have to focus. In neuroplasticity, when the brain is rewiring itself, it responds best to clear, specific directions, not to messages that are vague and unfocused.

If you want to get your wiring right, you have to focus. In neuroplasticity, when the brain is rewiring itself, it responds best to clear, specific directions, not to messages that are vague and unfocused. This is why you get better results when you know what you want than when you're uncertain about the desired outcome.

With most of the goals you set, the ones you're most likely to reach are the goals that have the most detail assigned to them. This is true because the clearer the picture you're able to give your brain, the more detailed the neural imprint of that goal will be recorded in your brain.

There is an underlying layer of brain activity that is called "mental noise." It is made up of random thoughts and feelings that are just at, or under, the surface of our consciousness. The problem is that much of this "noise" tells us what we "cannot" do in our lives, instead of telling us what we "can do."

When those random, often disconnected thoughts keep cropping up, stop for a moment and listen to them. They're not your higher self, but they are a high level of neural programs that are strong enough to make their way to your conscious mind.

They're not your higher self, but they are a high level of neural programs that are strong enough to make their way to your conscious mind. When you listen to them, you can decide which of them you want to keep, and which of them you want to change.

The problem is, much of that noise tends to be negative, and it can create a whole host of fears, self-doubts and problems.

The most important questions here are, "What do your unconscious programs say?" "What makes up the unconscious noise level of your life that is created by the neural recordings you have stored?" And more important to you now, "What do you want your brain to program into those endless neural pathways that end up as the "background" programs to your life in the future?"

When you say something to yourself, either positive or negative, you are potentially wiring it into your brain. Anything you say out loud, or think silently to yourself, that expresses a feeling about you or anything else, is self-talk.

When you say something to yourself, either positive or negative, you are potentially wiring it into your brain. Anything you say out loud, or think silently to yourself, that expresses a feeling about you or anything else, is self-talk. Some of your self-talk may be good, and some of it may be bad. All of it is being recorded by your brain.

This is the most common form of self-talk. It is self-talk of the negative, random, usually unconscious kind, in its often casual, yet always harmful form. This is the negative self-conversation that goes on in the minds of all of us until we learn to eliminate it from our lives.

Negative self-talk, and the way it wires the brain in a negative way, creates the difference between people who find success and happiness in life, and people who do not.

"Positive self-talk" is the supportive, high-quality, healthy, consciously self-directed form of self-talk. It is the process of sending specially-worded messages to ourselves to actively wire specific, positive neural pathways in the brain.

As we're discussing it here, positive self-talk is something we practice and learn. Positive self-talk is not an accident we can just hope for. Once you're grown, it doesn't come by accident. If you want to rewire your brain, learning it is a must.

Using positive self-talk is not an expression of naiveté, ignoring problems, or living a mindset of an unthinking person who is only "Pollyanna Positive." Positive self-talk addresses the problems of life, and deals with each of them. But while being realistic, it addresses those problems with an attitude of the expectation of optimal achievement, rather than with a belief that success is doubtful, or failure is likely.

Positive self-talk is made up of self-directed messages that we choose.

The right self-talk is the kind of wiring you can program by design. And you can make sure the self-talk you use contains the correct word-for-word instructions your brain needs for the best results.

What happened is that your brain is so smart and so fast that instead of just listening to the simple statement of negative self-talk you gave it ("I can't remember names"), like a tenacious reporter for a tabloid newspaper, your brain pulled up every similar (equally negative) thought or program you had on file.

The problem is that much of this "noise" tells us what we "cannot" do in our lives, instead of telling us what we "can do."

The source of the "noise" is your physical brain running on autopilot, working without your focused attention.

The most important questions here are, "What do your unconscious programs say?" "What makes up the unconscious noise level of your life that is created by the neural recordings you have stored?"

Our self-talk is the primary source of the new programs our brains have been wiring into place. It is our self-talk, good or bad, that the brain hears most. And it is our self-talk that ends up determining most of our successes or failures in life.

Positive self-talk is made up of self-directed messages that we choose. (I know many people who, each morning, choose to have a totally successful day. I have never met anyone who got up in the morning and said, "Today I choose to have the worst day of my life.") The right self-talk is the kind of wiring you can program by design. And you can make sure the self-talk you use contains the correct word-for-word instructions your brain needs for the best results.

Keep in mind that when you say anything to your brain, it will immediately search for and review every other program you have already wired in that is a similar kind of program.

What happened is that your brain is so smart and so fast that instead of just listening to the simple statement of negative self-talk you gave it ("I can't remember names"), like a tenacious reporter for a tabloid newspaper, your brain pulled up every similar (equally negative) thought or program you had on file.

The key to changing your self-talk is repetition, repetition, repetition. Whether you're listening to recorded self-talk sessions or practicing it daily on your own, the programs in the brain that are wired in most strongly, and most often, always end up being the programs that win.

It is this self-talk we use to make each day better and more in our control, but more importantly, it is also this form of self-talk that becomes the actual program directions we give to the brain when we want to create long-term program changes.

Self-talk is one of the most important "managers" of your neuroplasticity. That is, you direct your brain with self-talk emotionally, mentally (intellectually), and in every other way, as long as you choose to do so. It is your mind and your self-talk that feeds and teaches your brain.

At any time in the cycle, you can step in and change the cycle by choice of will. It is this amazing capability to change our own attitude that separates people of a positive mindset from people who wait in the darkness for someone to call (or something positive to happen).

All of these attitudes are "roles." None of them was actually real until we took on the character and brought it to life — characters made up of nothing more than neural networks in our brain, that someone else or our own negative self-talk put there in the first place.

With enough repetition, attitudes can become "personalities." A strong attitude, practiced over time, creates so many neural networks and connections in the brain that it takes on a life of its own — and the person literally becomes the personality of the attitude.

The good news is that because the problem of insensitive, negative programs was caused by the neuroplastic wiring of that person's brain, the same neuroplasticity can also rewire them out of the problem. To do that, what's required is that they become aware of the insensitive attitude, and through repetition of the right new programs, trade in the old attitude for a new one. The answer will be to consciously choose to adopt the new attitude, and repetition, repetition, repetition

That would suggest that your best — or strongest — attitudes will be those that have a wealth of imagery or repeated experience connected to them. This is why, instead of trying to create a "success attitude" just by demanding of yourself that you think or feel "successful," you're encouraged to visualize, and to put success-oriented pictures on a "vision board" on the wall, and focus on those pictures every day.

1. An Attitude of Optimism This attitude begins with self-talk that says, "I am up, positive, optimistic, and going for it!" Optimism is just plain healthy! We now know that statement is scientifically correct, and the relationship between your optimism and your health, well-being, and success in general is undeniable.

When you practice an attitude of optimism, you win more in life in every way,

2. An Attitude of Peace and Serenity (Meditation; In the moment; Unconditional happiness)

3. An Attitude of Kindness and Harmony Self-talk: "I care about others, and today I choose to express kindness and harmony in my life."

The opposite of that set of neural programs is to grow up believing people are good, people count, and life is not just about self-protection; life is about loving others, being kind and caring, and making things work.

4. An Attitude of Determination and Focus

4. An Attitude of Determination and Focus This attitude is announced with self-talk that says, "I am determined to reach my goal. I focus on my goal, I work at it, and I make it happen."

5. An Attitude of Intuition and Awareness Self-talk: "Today I choose to be clear and sharp, and tuned in to everything within me and around me. I am in touch with my intuition and my feelings, and I listen to the messages they give me."

7. An Attitude of Service to Others

8. An Attitude of Thankfulness Self-talk: "Today I choose to be thankful for all the good in my life. I am so fortunate to live the life I live, and right now is a good time to say 'Thank you.'"

9. An Attitude of Forgiveness Self-talk: "I choose to forgive … all others, and also myself. No matter what, I choose to forgive, and move on with my life."

10. An Attitude of Healthiness

1. You are in charge.

If you choose to take control, you will be in charge. You and your programming will be the direct result of your thoughts, your self-talk, what you desire most, and what you choose to do next.

2. The "input" you give your brain will form the neural pathways that you choose.

3. With the help of neuroplasticity, you get to create positive changes in your mind, your brain and your life.

4. Through repetition, your brain will create strong new neural pathways, and delete harmful old pathways.

5. Your goals and your intentions take on an important new meaning.

Our clearly-defined goals send signals to the brain that say, "This is the path I want to follow." Your brain records your intention. Your brain records your goals. And with your focus and your action, your brain helps you achieve the goal.

6. Your attitude is a choice. The attitude you choose each day will determine the quality and success of every day you live.

7. Your success in actively rewiring neural programs in your brain will depend on seven scientifically important rules.

They are, as I have identified them in this book, Mindfulness, Choices, Intention, Focus, Repetition, Emotion, and Belief.

8. Your "self-talk" will be a critically important factor in determining your success in your future.
